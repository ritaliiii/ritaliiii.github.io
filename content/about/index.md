Hi, I'm **Ning Li** — a data professional with a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

Currently, I’m a **Data Analyst Intern** at **Sephora’s Retail Data Technology team**, where I help migrate dashboards from Tableau to ThoughtSpot, validate data in Databricks, and ensure metric accuracy aligns with SLA standards. I thrive on building systems that help teams make smarter, faster decisions.

Previously, I gained hands-on experience at **Amazon** and **NetEase**, automating performance metric pipelines with Python, writing complex SQL queries, and building dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to support business operations.

### What I Bring

- Strong **technical fluency** in **SQL, Python, R, Databricks, Power BI, ThoughtSpot, and Tableau**, with hands-on experience in data pipelines, dashboarding, and performance optimization.
- A rare combination of **business insight**, **legal precision**, and **analytical thinking** — shaped by my education in **business (Boston University)**, **law (Northwestern University)**, and **computer science (Northeastern University)**.
- A collaborative mindset and user-first approach to data analytics and engineering challenges.

### Outside of Work

I’m a snowboarding enthusiast who loves taking on the mountain runs at **Palisades Tahoe**. There's nothing like carving down fresh powder to clear the mind and fuel new ideas. I also enjoy cooking Chinese dishes and explore data-driven storytelling.

Let’s connect! Whether it's a new data challenge, a business problem, or just a shared interest — I’m always open to meaningful conversations.
